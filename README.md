## Introduction

Frida is a powerful dynamic instrumentation toolkit that allows you to inject your own scripts into black box processes. With Frida, you can bypass security checks in Android applications, making it an essential tool for penetration testing and security research. This repository aims to streamline the script generation process, enabling you to create scripts quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- Generate Frida scripts for bypassing root detection in Android apps.
- Create scripts for SSL pinning bypass.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Customizable templates for different scenarios.
- Supports multiple Android versions and architectures.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saadffjg/frida-script-gen.git
cd frida-script-gen
```

Next, ensure you have Python installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can generate scripts using the command line. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script generator with the appropriate flags.

For example, to generate a root bypass script, use:

```bash
python generate_script.py --type root --app <app_package_name>
```

Replace `<app_package_name>` with the actual package name of the Android app.

## Script Generation

### Root Bypass Scripts

Root bypass scripts are essential for testing applications that implement root detection. The generator provides several templates that you can customize based on your needs. 

Hereâ€™s an example of how to generate a root bypass script:

```bash
python generate_script.py --type root --app com.example.app
```

This command will create a script tailored for the specified application. You can find the generated script in the `output` directory.

### SSL Pinning Bypass Scripts

SSL pinning is another common security measure in Android applications. The Frida Script Generator allows you to create scripts that bypass SSL pinning checks. 

To generate an SSL bypass script, run:

```bash
python generate_script.py --type ssl --app com.example.app
```

The generated script will also be located in the `output` directory.
